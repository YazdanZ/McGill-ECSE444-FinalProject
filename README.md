# McGill-ECSE444-FinalProject


## Design Problem
Morse code is an important communication method requiring little bandwidth and low complexity. Indeed, the famous SOS is still in use to signal distress worldwide. To introduce the code to new users and allow people to practice without touching a telegraph key (the input switch of a telegraph device), we seek to implement a morse code education device. The ideal device would feature a contactless telegraph key and enable bidirectional, full-duplex conversion from text to morse code and from morse code to text. The contactless acquisition of user inputs is critical during pandemic times and for accessibility purposes. Furthermore, digitally implementing this previously analog functionality allows us to introduce a vast array of features and extra functionality. These functionalities include using the speaker to translate morse code to text and using the LED to show the received text in morse code. They make this product more accessible to the visually or hearing impaired.

## Final Design

The project is a morse code education system, consisting of a contact-less input device (the board) and a terminal on a computer linked by USB cable.
